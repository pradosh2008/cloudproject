issues:
Production atg timestamps (staged as strings) were converted to UTC even though they are EST. They will have to be fixed.

implementation steps:
refresh edl_stage
refresh analytic_mart
run fix_pre_aw_transaction_header.bq


Bug fix notes:
bopis - fixed bad path in archive call
Many atg validation scripts fixed -- bug in time conversion




Check list:
reset_qa_buckets
reset_stage.bq
fix_stage.sh
go_qa_stage
run_bq_job - for stage
run_bq_job - for atg stage
rebuild_views
reset_mart.bq
